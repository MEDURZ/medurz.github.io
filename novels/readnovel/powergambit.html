            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The morning sunlight streamed through the window of Kai Paradox's small bedroom, warming the cluttered space with its golden glow. On the floor, a heap of brightly colored toys surrounded a model spaceship he'd built with his father last weekend. His bed, perpetually unmade, was adorned with a patchwork quilt his mother had sewn, patterned with stars and galaxies—her nod to his fascination with space.
                    <br><br>
                    "Kai! Breakfast!" his mother’s voice rang out from downstairs, slicing through the quiet hum of the morning.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai groaned and pulled his blanket over his head. At eight years old, he had perfected the art of procrastinating mornings. His alarm clock, shaped like a cartoon rocket, buzzed again, prompting him to slap the snooze button with a reluctant hand.  
                    <br><br>
                    From the kitchen below, the clatter of pans and the sizzle of bacon carried a comforting familiarity. His father, a tall, broad-shouldered man with a warm laugh, could be heard teasing his wife about her insistence on preparing a "balanced breakfast."  
                    <br><br>
                    “Balanced? Since when does bacon count as balanced, Lisa?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s protein, James! Besides, Kai’s not eating sugary cereal every morning under my watch,” she shot back.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai smiled despite himself. His parents' banter was as much a part of the morning routine as brushing his teeth.  
                    <br><br>
                    Throwing off his blanket, he hopped out of bed, ruffled his already unruly dark brown hair, and grabbed a clean shirt from his dresser. Today’s choice was an astronaut shirt, complete with a rocket blasting off from Earth.  
                    <br><br>
                    Downstairs, the kitchen was filled with the aroma of pancakes and freshly brewed coffee. Lisa Paradox, a petite woman with sharp eyes and a ready smile, stood at the stove flipping pancakes. Her short, practical haircut made her look younger than her thirty-five years. James sat at the table, newspaper spread wide, sipping from a steaming mug emblazoned with “#1 Dad.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Morning, sleepyhead,” James greeted as Kai shuffled in, his eyes still bleary.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Morning,” Kai mumbled, sliding into his usual seat.  
                    <br><br>
                    Lisa placed a plate in front of him. “Eat up. You’ve got a big day ahead.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “What’s so big about it?” Kai asked, cutting into his pancake lazily.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Well,” she began, “it’s career day at school, remember? And James, don’t you have that presentation at work?”  
                    <br><br>
                    James groaned. “Thanks for reminding me, Lisa. Nothing like pitching budget proposals to brighten a Monday.”  
                    <br><br>
                    The conversation flowed easily, filled with small jokes and laughter. Yet, beneath the ordinary rhythm of the morning, there was a strange sense of unease—a subtle tension Kai couldn’t quite name.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai's walk to school was unremarkable, the way most days felt at that age. The narrow streets of his suburban neighborhood were lined with identical houses, each with neatly trimmed lawns and picket fences. Birds chirped in the trees, and a neighbor waved as he passed.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai!” a familiar voice called.  
                    <br><br>
                    He turned to see Mike, his best friend since kindergarten, pedaling furiously toward him on his bike. Mike skidded to a halt beside him, his face flushed with excitement.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Guess what?” Mike said, his eyes wide with mischief.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m gonna bring a live frog to career day. It’ll freak out Mrs. Harper for sure.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai laughed. “You’re gonna get detention for a week.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Worth it,” Mike grinned, hopping off his bike to walk beside Kai.  
                    <br><br>
                    They arrived at school just as the bell rang. The day unfolded like any other—math problems, recess, and the occasional burst of laughter from the back of the classroom where Mike whispered his wild ideas. Yet, Kai couldn't shake the sense that something was different.  
                    <br><br>
                    As the afternoon sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the playground, Kai lingered near the swings. The breeze carried the scent of freshly cut grass, but his thoughts were elsewhere.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, you okay?” Mike asked, nudging him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. “Yeah. Just...thinking.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “About what?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai opened his mouth to answer but stopped. He wasn’t sure. There was nothing unusual about today—or was there?  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as he lay in bed, staring at the faint glow of the moon through his window, the feeling of unease returned. He rolled onto his side, clutching the edge of his quilt.  
                    <br><br>
                    Something was coming. He didn’t know what, but it was as though the universe itself was holding its breath.  </p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 2</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Math class was boring. It was always boring.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai Paradox sat at his desk in Room 3B, staring at a multiplication problem on the board. The numbers swam before his eyes like tiny fish, refusing to line up the way they were supposed to. He tapped his pencil against the desk, trying to focus.  
                    <br><br>
                    The classroom was filled with the usual sounds of shuffling papers, quiet murmurs, and Mrs. Harper’s chalk scratching against the board. She was explaining something about factors, but Kai had stopped listening five minutes ago.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, pay attention,” Mrs. Harper said, glancing his way.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yes, ma’am,” he muttered, sitting up straighter.  
                    <br><br>
                    He hated math, but it wasn’t just the numbers that were bothering him today. It was that same strange feeling from the morning. Like something was about to happen.  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil rolled out of his hand and clattered onto the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    Frustrated, Kai glared at the math problem in front of him. He squeezed his eyes shut and thought, <i>I just want this to be over.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    Then it happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil moved.  
                    <br><br>
                    Not just a little twitch. It floated—just for a second. It hovered about an inch above the desk, spinning slightly. Kai blinked, and the pencil dropped back down with a quiet thud.  
                    <br><br>
                    He froze, his heart pounding. Had anyone else seen?  
                    <br><br>
                    The other kids were busy with their work. Mrs. Harper’s back was to the class as she wrote something on the board.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Did that really just happen?</i> he thought.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai picked up the pencil slowly, turning it over in his hand. It felt normal—light, wooden, with a dull eraser on the end. But he couldn’t ignore what he’d just seen.  
                    <br><br>
                    He tried to focus on his worksheet again, but his mind was racing. He glanced around the room nervously, half expecting someone to call him out.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing.  
                    <br><br>
                    During recess, Kai sat alone on a bench near the soccer field. Mike was playing with a group of kids, yelling and laughing as they chased the ball.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai held his pencil in his lap, staring at it like it held all the answers.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, what’s up with you?” Mike called, jogging over.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shoved the pencil into his pocket quickly. “Nothing. Just thinking.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “About what? You never think,” Mike teased, flopping onto the bench beside him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Very funny.” Kai tried to smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike narrowed his eyes. “You okay? You’ve been weird all day.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” Kai said quickly, standing up. “Come on, let’s play.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike shrugged and followed him to the field. But as the game went on, Kai couldn’t stop thinking about the pencil.  
                    <br><br>
                    At home that evening, Kai sat at the kitchen table, pretending to do his homework.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Everything alright, Kai?” his mom asked as she washed dishes.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah. Why?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “You seem quiet today.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” he said, forcing a smile.  
                    <br><br>
                    She nodded, but her eyes lingered on him for a moment before she turned back to the sink.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s dad walked in, loosening his tie. “How’s my favorite kid doing?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m your only kid, Dad,” Kai replied automatically.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Doesn’t make it any less true.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai chuckled, but the smile faded as soon as his dad left the room.  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the pencil again, holding it carefully. <i>What if I wasn’t imagining it?</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    Upstairs in his room, Kai placed the pencil on his desk. He stared at it, his heart thudding in his chest.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Move,</i> he thought.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    He clenched his fists and tried again. <i>Move!</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil wobbled slightly. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to make Kai’s breath catch.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat back in his chair, staring at the pencil in disbelief.  
                    <br><br>
                    Something was happening to him—something strange and impossible.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="page" id="ch3">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter 3</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The next day felt like it stretched on forever.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai couldn’t stop thinking about the pencil. Every time he replayed the moment in his mind, it seemed more impossible. <i>Pencils don’t float</i>, he told himself again and again.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat in class, staring at the chalkboard while Mrs. Harper explained something about fractions. His pencil lay untouched on his desk. He didn’t dare try anything again—not here, not with everyone watching.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Mr. Paradox?” Mrs. Harper’s voice jolted him out of his thoughts.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Huh?”  
                    <br><br>
                    She gave him a stern look. “If you’re done daydreaming, perhaps you can solve the problem on the board?”  
                    <br><br>
                    The other kids snickered. Kai’s face turned red as he stood up and shuffled to the front of the room. He picked up the chalk with shaky hands, avoiding everyone’s eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    The math problem blurred in front of him. He tried to concentrate, but his thoughts kept spiraling. What if the pencil floated again? What if someone saw?  
                    <br><br>
                    “Any day now,” Mrs. Harper said impatiently.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai scribbled an answer on the board—any answer—and hurried back to his seat. He heard the laughter behind him as he sat down, but he didn’t care.  
                    <br><br>
                    At lunch, Mike slid into the seat beside him. “Okay, seriously, what’s going on?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing,” Kai muttered, poking at his sandwich.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned. “Come on, dude. You’ve been acting weird since yesterday. Did Mrs. Harper scare you or something?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “No. I’m fine,” Kai said, more forcefully this time.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike held up his hands. “Alright, alright. But if something’s up, you know you can tell me, right?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded, but he didn’t say anything else.  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat at his desk again, the same pencil lying in front of him.  
                    <br><br>
                    He’d been staring at it for an hour, willing it to move. But no matter how hard he tried, it stayed stubbornly still.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Maybe I imagined it,</i> he thought. <i>Maybe I’m just going crazy.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the pencil and turned it over in his hands. It felt so normal. There was nothing special about it—nothing that could explain what had happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai leaned back in his chair and sighed. His room felt too quiet, too small.  
                    <br><br>
                    The door creaked open, and his mom peeked in. “Kai? Everything okay?”  
                    <br><br>
                    He quickly shoved the pencil under a book. “Yeah. Just tired.”  
                    <br><br>
                    She walked in and sat on the edge of his bed. “You’ve seemed a little off lately. Want to talk about it?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. His mom was always good at listening, but how could he explain something like this?  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” he said finally.  
                    <br><br>
                    She smiled gently and ruffled his hair. “Alright. But if you ever need to talk, I’m here.”  
                    <br><br>
                    After she left, Kai pulled the pencil out again. He placed it carefully in the center of the desk and stared at it until his eyes burned.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Move,</i> he thought.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing.  
                    <br><br>
                    He slammed his fist on the desk, making the pencil jump slightly. But it didn’t float.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai felt a knot of frustration and fear growing in his chest. If he wasn’t imagining it, then what was going on? Was something wrong with him?  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, Kai lay awake in bed, staring at the ceiling. Moonlight filtered through the curtains, casting faint shadows on the walls.  
                    <br><br>
                    He couldn’t stop thinking about the pencil. About how it had floated, even for just a second.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>What if it happens again?</i> he wondered. <i>What if I can’t control it?</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The thought made his stomach churn. He rolled over and buried his face in his pillow, trying to push it all away. But sleep didn’t come easily.  
                    <br><br>
                    And when it finally did, it was restless, filled with strange dreams of objects floating and spinning around him.  </p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The day started like any other, but Kai couldn’t shake the restless feeling that had settled over him. The strange dreams from the night before lingered in his mind—images of floating objects and invisible forces pulling at him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Downstairs, the kitchen was a hub of morning chaos. The smell of scrambled eggs filled the air as Kai’s mom worked over the stove. His dad sipped coffee while reading the newspaper, and the radio played soft jazz in the background.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, grab the plates,” his mom called.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai opened the cabinet and carefully pulled out three plates. He hesitated for a moment, staring at them. What if something happened?  
                    <br><br>
                    He shook the thought away and carried the plates to the table.  
                    <br><br>
                    His mom glanced at him as she slid the eggs onto a platter. “You look tired. Did you stay up late?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “No,” Kai said quickly. “Just had weird dreams.”  
                    <br><br>
                    His dad folded the newspaper and gave Kai a curious look. “What kind of dreams?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing, really. Just...weird stuff.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Probably too many cartoons before bed,” his mom said with a smile.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai forced a laugh, but his chest felt tight. He didn’t want to talk about it—not with them, not with anyone.  
                    <br><br>
                    Later that afternoon, Kai helped his mom with the dishes. It was one of his least favorite chores, but she always insisted it built character.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Pass me the dish towel,” she said, rinsing a plate under the faucet.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai grabbed the towel and handed it to her.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Thanks. So, what’s going on at school?” she asked casually.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing much,” he replied, scrubbing a fork.  
                    <br><br>
                    “You’ve been awfully quiet lately,” she said, her tone light but probing.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” Kai said quickly. “Just tired.”  
                    <br><br>
                    She nodded, but the worry in her eyes was clear.  
                    <br><br>
                    As Kai reached for another plate, a truck rumbled by outside, shaking the house slightly. The plates in the drying rack rattled.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai froze.  
                    <br><br>
                    The rattling didn’t stop.  
                    <br><br>
                    At first, it was faint, almost like the vibration from the truck had lingered. But then the plates started to clink together louder, trembling against each other as if caught in a small quake.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, stop messing around,” his mom said, turning to look.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m not!” he said, panic rising in his voice.  
                    <br><br>
                    She frowned and reached out to steady the plates. The moment her hands touched them, they stopped moving.  
                    <br><br>
                    She looked at him, her eyebrows furrowed. “What was that?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I—I don’t know,” Kai stammered.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Probably the trucks,” she said after a moment, though her voice was uncertain.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded quickly. “Yeah, probably.”  
                    <br><br>
                    But he knew it wasn’t the trucks.  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat alone in his room, his heart still racing from what had happened in the kitchen.  
                    <br><br>
                    He didn’t understand what was going on. First the pencil, now the plates. It wasn’t normal.  
                    <br><br>
                    He grabbed his journal from the desk drawer and flipped it open. It was a plain notebook, the kind he usually used for doodles and notes. But now, it had become something else—a place to keep track of the strange things he couldn’t explain.  
                    <br><br>
                    He wrote quickly, his handwriting messy:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Day 1:</i> Pencil floated. Only for a second. No one saw.  <br>
                    <i>Day 2:</i> Tried to make it move again. It worked, but barely. Nobody noticed.  <br>
                    <i>Day 3:</i> Plates rattled in the kitchen. Mom saw but blamed the trucks.  <br>
                    <br><br>
                    Kai stared at the page, his pencil hovering over the next line. Should he tell someone?  
                    <br><br>
                    The thought made his stomach twist. If he told his parents, would they even believe him? Or would they think he was crazy?  
                    <br><br>
                    He closed the journal and shoved it back into the drawer. No one could know—not yet.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as Kai lay in bed, the fear returned. It wasn’t just about the floating pencil or the rattling plates. It was something deeper—a feeling that this was only the beginning.  
                    <br><br>
                    He pulled his blanket up to his chin and stared at the shadows on the ceiling.  
                    <br><br>
                    Whatever was happening to him, he had to figure it out.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 5</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The house was silent.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai lay awake in his bed, staring at the faint glow of his alarm clock. The numbers read 1:12 AM. He rolled over, but sleep wouldn’t come. His mind kept replaying the events of the past few days—the pencil, the plates, the strange feeling in his chest when it happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, he sat up, the quilt falling into a heap around him. The room was dim, the only light coming from the moon outside. He glanced at the door, listening for any sounds from his parents’ room.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing.  
                    <br><br>
                    Slowly, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood. His bare feet were silent on the wooden floor as he crept to his desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil was still there, lying in the exact spot where he’d left it earlier.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai took a deep breath and sat down.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Alright,</i> he thought, staring at the pencil. <i>Let’s figure this out.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    For the first ten minutes, nothing happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai tried everything he could think of. He stared at the pencil until his eyes watered. He clenched his fists, gritted his teeth, and even whispered under his breath, “Move. Come on. Move!”  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil didn’t budge.  
                    <br><br>
                    He groaned and leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples. Maybe he was imagining all of it. Maybe the pencil floating and the plates rattling were just coincidences.  
                    <br><br>
                    But deep down, he didn’t believe that.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai leaned forward again, his hands resting on the edge of the desk. He closed his eyes and focused on the pencil, picturing it in his mind.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Just a little,</i> he thought. <i>Just a tiny bit. Please.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    He felt something—a faint twinge in his chest, like a small spark.  
                    <br><br>
                    When he opened his eyes, the pencil wobbled.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s heart leapt. He blinked, afraid it might have been his imagination. But no—the pencil had moved, just barely.  
                    <br><br>
                    Excitement coursed through him. He sat up straighter, his hands gripping the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay,” he whispered. “Let’s try again.”  
                    <br><br>
                    For the next hour, Kai practiced.  
                    <br><br>
                    At first, the pencil only twitched, shifting slightly before falling still. But as the minutes passed, the movements became stronger. It tipped over, rolled, and once—just for a moment—it hovered a fraction of an inch above the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    By the time the clock read 2:37 AM, Kai was exhausted. His head ached, and his chest felt heavy, but he couldn’t stop smiling.  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the pencil, turning it over in his hands. It was the same as before—just a regular pencil. But now, it felt like something more.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai glanced at the small model spaceship sitting on his shelf. An idea sparked in his mind. He stood and grabbed it, placing it on the desk beside the pencil.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright,” he said softly. “Let’s see if I can do more than just pencils.”  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat back down and focused on the spaceship. It was heavier than the pencil, made of plastic and tiny metal parts.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He thought about the spark in his chest, the feeling he’d had when the pencil moved.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Just a little,</i> he thought. <i>Just enough to see it work.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The spark came again, faint but steady.  
                    <br><br>
                    When he opened his eyes, the spaceship tilted to one side.  
                    <br><br>
                    By the time Kai finally climbed back into bed, the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon. His body ached with exhaustion, but he felt a strange sense of pride.  
                    <br><br>
                    For the first time, he felt like he had some control over whatever was happening to him.  
                    <br><br>
                    As he drifted off to sleep, a small smile played on his lips.  </p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 6</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Kai sat at his desk, staring at the flyer his teacher had handed out that morning. In big, bold letters, it read:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>“Annual Science Fair – Projects Due in Two Weeks!”</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The entire class had groaned when Mrs. Harper announced the project. Science fairs were usually just an excuse for parents to build volcanoes or solar system models while the kids watched.  
                    <br><br>
                    But for Kai, this year was different.  
                    <br><br>
                    He twirled his pencil between his fingers, the words on the flyer blurring as he thought. Science was supposed to explain the world—how things worked, why things happened. Maybe it could explain what was happening to him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay,” Kai muttered to himself. “If I have to do this, I might as well make it useful.”  
                    <br><br>
                    He pulled out his notebook and began to brainstorm.  
                    <br><br>
                    At recess, Kai found Mike sitting under their usual tree, munching on a peanut butter sandwich.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, Mike,” Kai said, plopping down beside him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey. What’s up?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I need an idea for the science fair,” Kai said, trying to sound casual.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike grinned. “How about a frog-launching catapult?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai snorted. “Yeah, that’ll definitely win first prize.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, it’s better than a potato battery,” Mike said, shoving the last bit of sandwich into his mouth.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. “What about...magnetism?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned. “Like magnets and stuff? That sounds kinda boring.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shrugged. “Maybe. But I think it could be cool if I make it...different.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike gave him a suspicious look. “Different how?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I don’t know yet,” Kai said quickly. “But I’ll figure it out.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat at the kitchen table, scribbling in his notebook while his mom cooked dinner.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What’s all this?” she asked, glancing at the pages filled with messy diagrams and notes.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Science fair project,” Kai said without looking up.  
                    <br><br>
                    His mom smiled. “Look at you, all serious about school for once. What’s the project about?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Magnetism,” Kai said.  
                    <br><br>
                    She raised an eyebrow. “Sounds ambitious. Need any help?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “No, I’ve got it,” Kai said, flipping to a blank page.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright, but don’t wait until the last minute,” she said, setting a plate of spaghetti in front of him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I won’t,” Kai mumbled, though he wasn’t so sure.  
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next few days, Kai threw himself into the project. He borrowed books from the school library, watched videos online, and even asked his dad to take him to the hardware store to buy magnets and copper wire.  
                    <br><br>
                    But every time he worked on it, his thoughts drifted back to his powers.  
                    <br><br>
                    What if he could use them for the project? Would anyone notice?  
                    <br><br>
                    The idea both excited and terrified him.  
                    <br><br>
                    A week before the science fair, Kai set up his experiment in his room. He had built a small contraption using magnets, wires, and a motor he’d taken from an old toy car. The goal was to show how magnetism could create movement—something simple enough to explain but still impressive.  
                    <br><br>
                    As he worked, he couldn’t resist testing his powers.  
                    <br><br>
                    He placed a metal washer on the desk and focused on it, the way he’d practiced late at night.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Move,</i> he thought, his chest tightening with effort.  
                    <br><br>
                    The washer wobbled, then slid across the desk toward him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai grinned, his heart pounding.  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the washer and placed it back on the desk. This time, he tried something different. Instead of thinking about moving it, he imagined it hovering—floating just like the pencil had.  
                    <br><br>
                    The washer lifted off the desk, wobbling slightly before falling back down with a soft clink.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Whoa,” Kai whispered, staring at it.  
                    <br><br>
                    He couldn’t use his powers in front of everyone at the science fair. That much was obvious. But the thought of practicing in secret, of understanding what he could really do, made him feel a little less afraid.  
                    <br><br>
                    The night before the science fair, Kai lay in bed staring at the ceiling.  
                    <br><br>
                    His project was ready, and he felt confident it would work. But what really excited him wasn’t the magnets or the motor.  
                    <br><br>
                    It was the possibility that he could understand himself—that maybe, just maybe, science could help him figure out who he was becoming.  </p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 7</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The schoolyard was alive with the sounds of shouting kids and the thud of a soccer ball hitting the fence. Recess was always the best part of the day, and the playground buzzed with energy as groups of children scattered to their favorite activities.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai stood off to the side, hands stuffed in his pockets, watching as Mike and a few others chased the soccer ball across the uneven grass.  
                    <br><br>
                    “You’re not playing today?” Mike called, pausing long enough to give Kai a confused look.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nah,” Kai said, shaking his head. “Just not in the mood.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike shrugged and sprinted off after the ball, his laughter ringing out as he tackled another kid to steal possession.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai turned away and wandered toward the back of the playground, where the swings sat empty. He climbed onto one and kicked at the dirt, letting the chains creak as he swung lazily back and forth.  
                    <br><br>
                    In his pocket, he fingered the small metal washer he’d brought from home. It had become a habit lately—keeping something small and light with him, just in case.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai glanced around to make sure no one was watching. The teachers were busy chatting near the school building, and the other kids were too focused on their games.  
                    <br><br>
                    He pulled the washer out and held it in his palm, his fingers curling around it protectively.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Just a little,</i> he thought, focusing his mind on the washer.  
                    <br><br>
                    It wobbled slightly, tilting up on one edge before falling still.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s heart raced. He glanced around again, but no one seemed to notice.  
                    <br><br>
                    He closed his hand around the washer and sat there for a moment, his mind racing. He wanted to try again—maybe even do something bigger—but the risk of being caught made his stomach churn.  
                    <br><br>
                    After school, Kai and Mike headed to the library.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike flopped into a chair near the back, pulling a comic book from his backpack. “You’re acting weird again,” he said without looking up.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” Kai said quickly, flipping through a book about magnets.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike lowered the comic and raised an eyebrow. “Come on, dude. You’ve been all secretive and stuff lately. What’s going on?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing,” Kai muttered, keeping his eyes on the page.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike sighed and leaned back in his chair, tossing the comic onto the table. “You’re such a bad liar.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai froze, his fingers tightening on the book. He wanted to tell Mike—he really did. But how could he explain something like this?  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’ll tell you later,” Kai said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Promise?” Mike asked, leaning forward.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated, then nodded. “Promise.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat at his desk, staring at the washer again.  
                    <br><br>
                    He wanted to test himself, to see what else he could do. But every time he tried, a wave of fear held him back.  
                    <br><br>
                    What if something went wrong? What if someone found out?  
                    <br><br>
                    He clenched his fists and took a deep breath. “Just try,” he whispered to himself.  
                    <br><br>
                    He placed the washer in the middle of the desk and closed his eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Lift,</i> he thought, the word repeating in his mind like a drumbeat.  
                    <br><br>
                    The spark in his chest flared, and when he opened his eyes, the washer was floating.  
                    <br><br>
                    It hovered an inch above the desk, spinning slowly in the air. Kai stared at it, hardly daring to breathe.  
                    <br><br>
                    Then, with a soft clink, it fell back to the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai exhaled, his whole body trembling.  
                    <br><br>
                    He’d done it.  
                    <br><br>
                    The next day, Kai found a quiet spot behind the school library during lunch.  
                    <br><br>
                    He pulled the washer out of his pocket and placed it on the ground.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright,” he muttered, kneeling down. “Let’s see how far this goes.”  
                    <br><br>
                    He focused on the washer, his mind zeroing in on the small object.  
                    <br><br>
                    It wobbled, then lifted into the air. Kai grinned, his excitement building as it floated higher.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Whoa.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s heart stopped. He turned to see Mike standing a few feet away, his mouth hanging open.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Mike!” Kai yelped, grabbing the washer as it fell. “What are you doing here?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I could ask you the same thing,” Mike said, walking closer. “Dude, what was that?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “It was...nothing,” Kai said quickly, shoving the washer into his pocket.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike crossed his arms. “That didn’t look like nothing. That washer was floating.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated, his mind racing. He couldn’t lie—Mike had seen everything.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright,” Kai said finally, his voice low. “But you can’t tell anyone. Promise?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike’s eyes lit up. “Are you kidding? This is the coolest thing ever!”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m serious, Mike. If anyone finds out—”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I won’t say anything,” Mike said quickly. “But you have to show me how you did it.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai sighed. “Fine. But not here.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, Kai and Mike sat in Kai’s room, the door locked and the curtains drawn.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright,” Kai said, placing the washer on his desk. “Watch carefully.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike leaned forward, his eyes wide with anticipation.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai focused, his chest tightening as he willed the washer to move. Slowly, it lifted off the desk, spinning gently in the air.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Whoa,” Mike whispered.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai let it fall back to the desk and turned to face his friend. “Now you see why no one can know.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike nodded, his expression serious. “Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone. But...what are you gonna do with it?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I don’t know,” Kai admitted. “I just want to understand it.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike grinned. “Well, if you ever decide to become a superhero, let me know.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai chuckled, but the weight of what he’d shown Mike lingered in the back of his mind.  </p>

        <div class="page" id="ch8">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter 8</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            It had been a week since Mike found out about Kai’s secret. To Kai’s surprise, Mike hadn’t blabbed to anyone—not even when their teacher caught him daydreaming in class and asked what was so interesting.  
                    <br><br>
                    But having Mike know the truth was both a relief and a constant source of tension. Every time they talked about it, Kai felt a mix of excitement and dread.  
                    <br><br>
                    Now, they sat together behind the school library during recess, away from prying eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay, show me again,” Mike said, practically bouncing on his heels.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Mike, we can’t keep doing this,” Kai whispered, glancing around nervously.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Come on! No one’s around,” Mike said, waving his arms at the empty yard.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai sighed. He pulled a small paperclip from his pocket and placed it on the ground between them.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Fine. But this is the last time.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike nodded eagerly.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai took a deep breath and focused on the paperclip. The now-familiar spark ignited in his chest, and the paperclip wobbled before lifting into the air. It spun slowly, catching the sunlight before dropping back to the ground.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike let out a low whistle. “Man, that is awesome.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai picked up the paperclip and shoved it back into his pocket. “It’s not awesome. It’s...weird. What if someone finds out?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Then we make a deal with the government,” Mike said, grinning. “They’ll probably give us free ice cream or something.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai rolled his eyes. “Yeah, right. More like they’ll stick me in a lab.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike’s grin faded. “You really think so?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded, his stomach tightening. “I don’t know what this is, but it’s not normal. If anyone finds out, it’s game over.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned but didn’t argue.  
                    <br><br>
                    That afternoon, Kai sat in the back of the classroom, trying to focus on his homework. But his thoughts kept drifting.  
                    <br><br>
                    What if Mike was right? What if there was some way to use his powers without getting in trouble?  
                    <br><br>
                    But every time he let himself imagine the possibilities, the fear crept in. What if someone saw him? What if they told?  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shook his head and bent over his notebook. He needed to focus on normal things—things that didn’t make his chest feel like it was about to explode.  
                    <br><br>
                    Later, as they walked home from school, Mike kept glancing at Kai like he was waiting to say something.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Spit it out,” Kai said finally.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike hesitated. “You know, you could probably get better at it if you practiced more.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I already practice,” Kai said.  
                    <br><br>
                    “No, I mean, like...bigger stuff,” Mike said, gesturing wildly. “You’ve been lifting little things, but what if you tried something heavier? Like, I don’t know, a rock or something?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shook his head. “That’s too risky.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “But you don’t know until you try,” Mike insisted. “Come on, we could go to the park after dinner. No one’s ever there at night.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. The idea of pushing himself further was tempting. He wanted to know how far his powers could go.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Fine,” he said finally. “But if anything goes wrong, we’re out of there.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike grinned. “Deal.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, they met at the park, their flashlights cutting through the darkness.  
                    <br><br>
                    “This is so cool,” Mike said, his voice low but excited.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Let’s just get this over with,” Kai muttered, scanning the empty park.  
                    <br><br>
                    They found a small clearing near the edge of the woods, far enough from the houses that no one would notice them.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike pointed to a large rock sitting in the middle of the clearing. “Try that.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai stared at the rock, doubt gnawing at him. “What if I can’t do it?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Then we keep trying,” Mike said. “Come on, you’ve got this.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai took a deep breath and stepped closer to the rock. He crouched down and placed his hand on it, feeling the cool surface beneath his fingers.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay,” he whispered. “Here goes.”  
                    <br><br>
                    He closed his eyes and focused, imagining the rock lifting off the ground. The spark in his chest flared, stronger than before.  
                    <br><br>
                    The rock shifted, then lifted a few inches into the air.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike let out a gasp. “No way!”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai opened his eyes, his heart pounding as the rock hovered in front of him.  
                    <br><br>
                    But then the spark faltered.  
                    <br><br>
                    The rock wobbled and crashed back to the ground with a heavy thud.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai stumbled back, his chest heaving.  
                    <br><br>
                    “That was incredible!” Mike said, grabbing Kai’s shoulders. “You just lifted a rock, dude!”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shook his head. “It wasn’t much.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Are you kidding? That was amazing!”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai couldn’t help but smile. For the first time, he felt a small glimmer of hope.  
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe he wasn’t just a freak.  
                    <br><br>
                    As they left the park, neither of them noticed the figure watching them from the shadows.  
                    <br><br>
                    The man’s eyes followed Kai as he walked away, his expression unreadable.  </p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The next day after school, Kai and Mike met at their usual spot under the big oak tree by the park. Mike was already there, sprawled out on the grass, tossing a small rubber ball into the air and catching it lazily.  
                    <br><br>
                    “You’re late,” Mike said without looking up.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai flopped down beside him. “I had to stay after class. Mrs. Harper wanted to ‘talk about my potential.’” He mimicked her stern voice, rolling his eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike snorted. “Yeah, because you’re <i>so</i> full of potential.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai chuckled but quickly grew serious. He plucked a blade of grass and began twisting it between his fingers. “You know, last night was...different.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Different how?” Mike asked, sitting up.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shrugged. “The rock—it was heavier than anything I’ve tried before. And when I lifted it, I felt...I don’t know, stronger. Like I was pulling from something bigger.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike’s eyes lit up. “That’s awesome! See? I told you, you’re just scratching the surface.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. “But what if it’s dangerous? What if I can’t control it?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike tossed the ball aside and turned to face him. “Kai, you’ve got something incredible. You just need to keep practicing. And you don’t have to do it alone—I’ll help you.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai met his friend’s gaze. “You really mean that?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Of course,” Mike said, grinning. “What are best friends for?”  
                    <br><br>
                    They spent the afternoon brainstorming ideas for Kai’s practice sessions.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What about speed?” Mike suggested. “Can you move things faster?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai frowned. “I don’t know. I’ve only been focusing on lifting stuff.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Well, let’s try it,” Mike said, grabbing a small stick. He placed it on the ground in front of Kai. “See how fast you can move this.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded and crouched down, his hands resting on his knees. He focused on the stick, willing it to slide across the dirt.  
                    <br><br>
                    The familiar spark flared in his chest, and the stick twitched before zipping forward a few inches.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yes!” Mike cheered, jumping to his feet.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai grinned, his heart racing. He tried again, this time pushing the stick further and faster. It skidded across the ground, hitting a rock with a satisfying clink.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Dude, you’re getting good at this,” Mike said, clapping him on the back.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai laughed, the tension in his chest easing for the first time in days.  
                    <br><br>
                    As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Mike turned to Kai with a serious expression.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, can I ask you something?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Sure,” Kai said, brushing dirt off his jeans.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike hesitated, then said, “What are you gonna do if...you know, someone finds out? Like a teacher, or your parents, or...” He trailed off, his face clouded with worry.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai looked down at his hands. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “I don’t think I can hide it forever. But for now, I just want to figure out what this is.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike nodded slowly. “Well, no matter what happens, I’ve got your back. Okay?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai smiled. “Thanks, Mike. That means a lot.”  
                    <br><br>
                    They bumped fists, a silent promise passing between them.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as Kai lay in bed, he thought about Mike’s words.  
                    <br><br>
                    It felt good to have someone who knew his secret—someone who didn’t think he was a freak. But the thought of being discovered still made his stomach churn.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai stared at the ceiling, the faint glow of moonlight casting shadows on the walls.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>I have to be careful,</i> he thought. <i>But at least I’m not alone anymore.</i>  </p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Gym class was always a chaotic mix of squeaky sneakers, shouted instructions, and kids trying their best to look like they were playing without actually putting in much effort. Today was no different.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai stood near the edge of the basketball court, watching as a group of kids fumbled through a game. Coach Daniels blew his whistle, his voice booming across the gym.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Paradox! You’re up!”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai groaned inwardly. He wasn’t bad at basketball, but he didn’t love it either. Still, he jogged onto the court, wiping his sweaty palms on his shorts.  
                    <br><br>
                    The game resumed with its usual frantic energy. Kai darted between players, trying to keep up. The ball passed from one kid to another, bouncing off the court with loud thuds.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai! Over here!”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai turned just in time to see the ball hurtling toward him. He caught it awkwardly, stumbling back a step.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Shoot!” someone yelled.  
                    <br><br>
                    He hesitated, the basket seeming impossibly far away. The other team’s players closed in, their sneakers squeaking against the polished floor.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai took a deep breath and aimed.  
                    <br><br>
                    The ball arced through the air, wobbling slightly as it neared the basket.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Please go in,</i> Kai thought desperately.  
                    <br><br>
                    And then, something strange happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    For a split second, Kai felt the now-familiar spark in his chest. The ball seemed to correct its path, veering slightly before dropping cleanly through the hoop.  
                    <br><br>
                    The gym erupted in cheers.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nice shot!” one of his teammates shouted, clapping him on the back.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai forced a smile, but his mind was racing. <i>Did I just do that?</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The rest of the game passed in a blur. Kai avoided touching the ball again, afraid of what might happen.  
                    <br><br>
                    After class, he lingered by the bleachers, pretending to tie his shoe as the other kids filed out.  
                    <br><br>
                    “You okay?” Mike asked, hanging back to wait for him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai glanced around to make sure they were alone. “Something weird happened,” he said in a low voice.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike raised an eyebrow. “Weirder than usual?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded. “I think...I think I moved the ball. Just a little. Like, I didn’t mean to, but it felt like I did.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike’s eyes widened. “No way. That’s awesome!”  
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s not awesome!” Kai hissed. “What if someone noticed?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike shrugged. “No one said anything. And besides, it’s not like you’re glowing or floating or something. Chill.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai sighed. “I guess. But I need to be more careful.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai couldn’t stop thinking about the game. He replayed the moment in his mind—the spark, the ball shifting midair, the way it seemed to follow his will.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat at his desk, staring at the notebook where he’d been tracking his powers.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Day 10:</i> Controlled a basketball, sort of. Didn’t mean to. No one noticed.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai closed the notebook and leaned back in his chair. The more his powers grew, the harder it was to keep them hidden.  
                    <br><br>
                    The next morning, as Kai walked to school, he spotted something that made his stomach drop.  
                    <br><br>
                    A man in a black suit was standing near the playground fence, watching the kids as they arrived.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai froze, his heart pounding. The man’s gaze seemed to linger on him for a moment before shifting away.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, you coming?” Mike called, jogging up beside him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded quickly, forcing himself to move.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Who’s that guy?” Mike asked, glancing at the man.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I don’t know,” Kai said, his voice tight.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Maybe he’s a parent,” Mike suggested.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Maybe,” Kai muttered, though he didn’t believe it.  
                    <br><br>
                    As they walked into the school building, Kai couldn’t shake the feeling that the man’s eyes were still on him.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Over the next few weeks, Kai’s abilities became harder to ignore.  
                    <br><br>
                    At first, it was small things—objects moving slightly when he was upset or tired. But soon, the changes became more noticeable. He could feel the spark in his chest more often now, a faint hum that seemed to be waiting for his command.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai practiced in secret whenever he could, always careful to keep the door locked and the curtains closed. His room became a makeshift training ground, littered with small objects he could lift, spin, and push across the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    But no matter how much he practiced, the fear lingered.  
                    <br><br>
                    One evening, Kai sat cross-legged on his bedroom floor, staring at a toy car he’d set in front of him. The room was quiet except for the soft hum of the ceiling fan overhead.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright,” he muttered to himself. “Let’s try something new.”  
                    <br><br>
                    He closed his eyes and focused, picturing the car in his mind. He imagined it lifting off the ground, its wheels spinning in the air.  
                    <br><br>
                    The spark flared in his chest, stronger than ever.  
                    <br><br>
                    When he opened his eyes, the car was hovering a foot above the floor. It wobbled slightly, but it stayed in the air.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai grinned, his heart pounding. He focused harder, willing the car to move forward. It inched across the room, floating toward his bed.  
                    <br><br>
                    Suddenly, the spark faltered. The car dropped to the floor with a loud clatter.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai? Everything okay in there?” his mom’s voice called from the hallway.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai scrambled to his feet, kicking the car under his bed. “Yeah, I’m fine!”  
                    <br><br>
                    He held his breath as the sound of her footsteps faded.  
                    <br><br>
                    The next day at school, Kai found himself staring at the black car parked across the street.  
                    <br><br>
                    It had been there for three days now, always in the same spot.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What’s up with you?” Mike asked, nudging Kai as they walked to class.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing,” Kai said quickly, tearing his eyes away from the car.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned. “You’ve been jumpy lately. Did something happen?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. “I think...someone might be watching me.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike’s eyes widened. “Seriously? Who?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai gestured toward the car. “See that? It’s been there all week.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike squinted at the car, then shrugged. “Maybe it’s just a neighbor or something.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Maybe,” Kai said, but the unease in his chest wouldn’t go away.  
                    <br><br>
                    That afternoon, Kai went straight to his room after school.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat on his bed, staring at his hands. He could feel the spark inside him, like a coiled spring waiting to be released.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>I need to get better at this,</i> he thought. <i>If someone’s watching me, I have to be ready.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai remembered a TV show he’d seen about meditation and focus. The host had talked about clearing your mind, breathing deeply, and finding your center.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat cross-legged on the floor, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath.  
                    <br><br>
                    The spark in his chest felt closer now, more accessible. He focused on it, imagining it as a glowing ball of light.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Stay calm,</i> he told himself. <i>Stay in control.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The spark grew brighter in his mind, and he felt a strange sense of peace wash over him.  
                    <br><br>
                    When he opened his eyes, a pair of small pencils were floating in front of him, spinning slowly in the air.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai smiled.  
                    <br><br>
                    As the days passed, Kai’s control improved. He found that staying calm and focused made it easier to use his abilities. When he let fear or frustration take over, the spark would falter, and things would spiral out of control.  
                    <br><br>
                    But with practice, he was able to lift heavier objects, move things faster, and even hold multiple items in the air at once.  
                    <br><br>
                    Still, the black car across the street remained.  
                    <br><br>
                    One evening, as Kai sat on his bed writing in his notebook, his dad poked his head into the room.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, buddy. You’ve been cooped up in here a lot lately. Everything okay?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah, just homework,” Kai said quickly, closing the notebook.  
                    <br><br>
                    His dad walked in and sat on the edge of the bed. “You know, when I was your age, I used to spend hours building model airplanes. Drove my mom crazy with all the glue and paint everywhere.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai smiled faintly. “Sounds fun.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “It was. But you know what made it even better?” his dad said, ruffling his hair.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Sharing it with someone,” his dad said, his voice soft.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai looked down at his hands. “I’m fine, Dad. Really.”  
                    <br><br>
                    His dad sighed and stood. “Alright. But if you ever need to talk, you know where to find me.”  
                    <br><br>
                    As the door closed behind him, Kai felt a pang of guilt.  
                    <br><br>
                    He wished he could tell his dad the truth, but the thought of what might happen if he did was too much to bear. </p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 12</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The school library was a quiet refuge, far from the chaos of classrooms and noisy hallways. Rows of books stretched endlessly, their spines neatly aligned and glowing softly in the afternoon sunlight streaming through the tall windows.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai wandered aimlessly between the shelves, letting his fingers brush against the books as he passed. He wasn’t really looking for anything in particular, but something about the library felt safe.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Lost, Paradox?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai turned to see Mrs. Thompson, the librarian, peering at him over her glasses.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Just looking,” Kai said quickly.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mrs. Thompson smiled. “Well, if you need help, let me know.” She turned back to her desk, her bracelets jingling softly as she moved.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai continued walking, his eyes scanning the rows of books. He rounded a corner and stopped in front of a section labeled <i>“Unexplained Phenomena.”</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    For a moment, he hesitated. Then, his curiosity got the better of him.  
                    <br><br>
                    The books in this section were old, their covers faded and their pages yellowed with age. Titles like <i>The Mystery of the Mind</i> and <i>Unlocking Your Hidden Potential</i> jumped out at him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai pulled a book from the shelf. It was thick and heavy, the title stamped in gold letters:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>“Telekinesis: Myth or Reality?”</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    His breath caught. Telekinesis.  
                    <br><br>
                    He opened the book, flipping through its pages quickly. Diagrams of brains, charts, and photographs of people concentrating on objects filled the pages.  
                    <br><br>
                    One sentence caught his eye:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"The phenomenon of telekinesis, or the ability to move objects with the mind, has been a topic of debate for centuries. While skeptics dismiss it as pseudoscience, others believe it is an untapped human potential."</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s hands trembled as he turned the page. The words seemed to jump out at him, confirming what he’d been afraid to admit.  
                    <br><br>
                    This was real.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai spent the rest of the afternoon buried in the book.  
                    <br><br>
                    He learned about experiments where people had claimed to move objects with their minds, techniques for focusing mental energy, and theories about how emotions could amplify the ability.  
                    <br><br>
                    One section stood out:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"Practitioners often report a ‘tingling’ or ‘spark-like’ sensation in the chest or head before successfully moving an object. This sensation is thought to be the activation of latent neural pathways."</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai sat back, his mind racing. That spark—it was exactly what he felt every time he used his powers.  
                    <br><br>
                    He glanced around to make sure no one was watching, then slipped the book into his backpack.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, Kai sat at his desk, the library book open in front of him. He read through the pages again, taking notes in his notebook.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Day 15:</i> Found a book about telekinesis. Talks about the spark I feel. Says emotions might make it stronger.  
                    <br><br>
                    The idea that his powers could be tied to his emotions made sense. He’d noticed before that when he was scared or angry, his abilities became harder to control.  
                    <br><br>
                    He closed the notebook and leaned back in his chair, staring at the book.  
                    <br><br>
                    If this was real—if telekinesis was something people could actually do—what did that mean for him?  
                    <br><br>
                    The next day at school, Kai showed the book to Mike.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Whoa,” Mike said, flipping through the pages. “You found this in the library?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded. “It explains a lot. Like the spark I feel—that’s normal for people who can do this.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “People like you,” Mike said, grinning.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah,” Kai said, though the word felt strange.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike looked up from the book. “So, what’s the plan? Are you gonna keep practicing? Or...I don’t know, go full superhero?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai rolled his eyes. “I’m just trying to figure this out, Mike. I’m not saving the world or anything.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yet,” Mike added with a smirk.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai sighed but couldn’t help smiling.  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai decided to test the book’s theories.  
                    <br><br>
                    He cleared his desk, placing a series of objects in a row: a pencil, a coin, and a small toy car.  
                    <br><br>
                    He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, focusing on the pencil. He thought about the spark, the way it flared in his chest when he concentrated.  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil wobbled, then lifted into the air.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai opened his eyes and grinned. He moved on to the coin, focusing harder this time. The spark grew stronger, and the coin spun in midair before dropping back onto the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, he tried the toy car.  
                    <br><br>
                    This time, he imagined the spark growing brighter, spreading through his whole body. The car lifted smoothly, hovering several inches above the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yes!” Kai whispered, his excitement bubbling over.  
                    <br><br>
                    For the first time, Kai felt like he was beginning to understand his powers.  
                    <br><br>
                    But as he sat there, the book still open on his desk, a nagging thought crept into his mind.  
                    <br><br>
                    If telekinesis was real, then other people might know about it too.  
                    <br><br>
                    And not all of them would be friendly. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="page" id="ch13">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter 13</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Kai’s neighborhood always felt safe. The quiet streets, the rows of identical houses with perfectly trimmed lawns—it was the kind of place where nothing ever happened. But lately, something had changed.  
                    <br><br>
                    It started with the black car.  
                    <br><br>
                    At first, Kai had thought it was just a neighbor’s visitor or someone lost looking for directions. But the car had been parked across the street from his house for three days now, always in the same spot.  
                    <br><br>
                    And the driver was always watching.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai noticed him every morning as he left for school—a man in dark sunglasses, pretending to read a newspaper or scroll on his phone. But his gaze would flick toward Kai just a little too often.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Mike,” Kai whispered as they sat on the swings at recess.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What?” Mike asked, lazily kicking at the dirt.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I think someone’s watching me.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike stopped swinging and gave him a skeptical look. “You’re just being paranoid.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m serious,” Kai insisted. “There’s this guy in a black car. He’s been outside my house for days.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned. “Okay, that’s creepy. Did you tell your parents?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shook his head. “What am I supposed to say? ‘Hey, Mom and Dad, I think some guy’s spying on me because I have telekinesis’? Yeah, that’ll go over great.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike tilted his head, considering. “Maybe it’s not about your powers. Maybe it’s...I don’t know, some boring adult thing. Like insurance or something.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Maybe,” Kai muttered, but he didn’t believe it.  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat at the kitchen table, pushing his food around his plate. His parents were talking about work—his mom complaining about a stubborn client, his dad joking about office politics.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, you’ve been quiet lately,” his mom said suddenly, her sharp eyes narrowing on him. “Is something wrong?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “No,” Kai said quickly. “I’m fine.”  
                    <br><br>
                    She frowned, but before she could press him further, his dad chimed in.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Probably just school stress,” his dad said with a chuckle. “I remember hating math at his age too.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai forced a laugh, grateful for the distraction.  
                    <br><br>
                    But as the conversation shifted, he couldn’t help glancing out the window. The black car was still there, its headlights glowing faintly in the dusk.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, Kai decided to take a closer look.  
                    <br><br>
                    After his parents went to bed, he slipped on his sneakers and crept out the back door. The cool night air sent a shiver down his spine as he made his way around the side of the house.  
                    <br><br>
                    The car was still parked in its usual spot, the driver’s figure barely visible through the tinted windows.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai crouched behind a bush, his heart pounding. He felt the spark in his chest, faint but steady, as if it were urging him forward.  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up a small rock and held it in his hand.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Just a little,</i> he thought. <i>Just to see what happens.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The spark flared, and the rock floated into the air. Kai willed it forward, sending it gently toward the car. It tapped the window softly, making a faint <i>clink</i>.  
                    <br><br>
                    The figure inside shifted, his head snapping toward the noise.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai ducked lower, his heart racing. He watched as the driver stepped out of the car, scanning the area. The man was tall and broad-shouldered, dressed in a sharp black suit.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai held his breath, his chest tightening.  
                    <br><br>
                    The man looked around for a few moments, then climbed back into the car.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai waited until the headlights turned off before sneaking back inside.  
                    <br><br>
                    The next morning, the car was gone.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Maybe he got bored,” Mike said when Kai told him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Or maybe he saw me,” Kai replied, his stomach twisting at the thought.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. “Hey, if he didn’t do anything, maybe it’s not that bad. Just keep your head down, okay?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded, but the unease lingered.  
                    <br><br>
                    That afternoon, as Kai walked home from school, he felt it again—the sensation of being watched.  
                    <br><br>
                    He glanced over his shoulder and spotted another man, this one in a gray suit, leaning against a lamppost. The man’s eyes followed Kai as he walked past, his expression unreadable.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s hands clenched into fists.  
                    <br><br>
                    When he reached his house, he ran upstairs to his room and locked the door.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat on his bed, staring out the window. If these people were watching him, it could only mean one thing.  
                    <br><br>
                    They knew.  </p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Monday mornings were never fun, but this one felt off from the moment Kai walked into class.  
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of Mrs. Harper’s familiar, no-nonsense presence, a stranger stood at the front of the room. She was tall and elegant, with sharp features and a smile that didn’t quite reach her piercing blue eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Good morning, class,” she said in a smooth, clear voice. “I’m Miss Vance, your substitute teacher. Mrs. Harper is out sick, so I’ll be filling in for the next couple of weeks.”  
                    <br><br>
                    The room buzzed with whispers as the students exchanged curious looks. Substitutes were usually frazzled and overwhelmed, but Miss Vance radiated an unsettling calm.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai slid into his seat, his stomach twisting. There was something about her that made his skin crawl.  
                    <br><br>
                    As the lesson began, Miss Vance moved around the classroom, her sharp eyes scanning the room like a hawk.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai Paradox,” she said suddenly, her gaze locking onto him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai froze. “Yes?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Would you mind answering the question on the board?” she asked, her tone pleasant but firm.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai looked at the board, realizing he hadn’t been paying attention. The math problem was simple, but his mind was too scattered to focus.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Uh...seven?” he guessed.  
                    <br><br>
                    Miss Vance smiled, though her expression seemed more like a smirk. “Not quite, but close. Pay attention, please.”  
                    <br><br>
                    The class snickered, and Kai’s face burned as he slumped lower in his seat.  
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the day, Kai couldn’t shake the feeling that Miss Vance was watching him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Every time she walked past his desk, he felt her eyes linger on him for a moment too long. During lunch, he caught her standing by the window, her gaze fixed on the playground where he and Mike sat.  
                    <br><br>
                    “She’s creepy,” Mike muttered, biting into his sandwich.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded. “I think she’s watching me.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike raised an eyebrow. “Like the guys in the car?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Maybe,” Kai said. “I don’t know. But something about her isn’t right.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That afternoon, Miss Vance handed out worksheets and walked around the room as the students worked.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai,” she said softly, stopping beside his desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    He looked up, startled. “Yes?”  
                    <br><br>
                    She crouched down so they were eye level. “You’re quite a bright student,” she said, her tone almost too friendly.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Uh, thanks,” Kai muttered, gripping his pencil tightly.  
                    <br><br>
                    She tilted her head, her sharp eyes narrowing slightly. “You seem...different from the others.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s heart raced. “I don’t know what you mean.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Her smile returned, but it didn’t feel reassuring. “Oh, I think you do.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Before he could respond, she straightened and walked away, leaving him frozen in his seat.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, Kai told Mike about the conversation.  
                    <br><br>
                    “She definitely knows,” Kai said, pacing his room. “She said I was different. What does that even mean?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned, sitting cross-legged on the bed. “It could mean anything. Maybe she’s just weird.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Or maybe she’s here because of me,” Kai said, his voice rising.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay, calm down,” Mike said, holding up his hands. “We don’t know that for sure. Just...act normal. Don’t give her a reason to notice you.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded, but his chest felt tight.  
                    <br><br>
                    The next day, Miss Vance continued her strange behavior.  
                    <br><br>
                    During science class, she asked Kai a series of oddly specific questions.  
                    <br><br>
                    “So, Kai,” she began, leaning against her desk. “Do you like science?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Uh, yeah,” he said cautiously.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Fascinating subject, isn’t it?” she said, her smile sharp. “Especially topics like...magnetism. Or energy fields.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s hands clenched under the desk. “Yeah, I guess.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Miss Vance studied him for a moment, then moved on to the next student.  
                    <br><br>
                    By the end of the week, Kai was on edge. Miss Vance’s constant attention felt like a spotlight he couldn’t escape.  
                    <br><br>
                    He began avoiding her whenever possible, keeping his head down and sticking close to Mike. But no matter what he did, he couldn’t shake the feeling that she was onto him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Late Friday afternoon, as the school emptied out, Kai spotted Miss Vance standing near the front doors, her sharp gaze sweeping over the departing students.  
                    <br><br>
                    He ducked his head and hurried past, but he felt her eyes on him the entire way home.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as he lay in bed, he stared at the ceiling, his mind racing.  
                    <br><br>
                    If Miss Vance knew about his powers, then he was in more danger than he’d realized.  
                    <br><br>
                    And he had no idea what to do about it.  </p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 15</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The house was unusually quiet as Kai sat at the kitchen table, picking at his breakfast. His mom stood by the stove, her back turned as she flipped pancakes. Normally, she’d be chatting about her day or reminding him to clean his room, but today, she seemed distracted.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, honey,” she said after a long silence, her tone cautious.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah?” he replied, looking up.  
                    <br><br>
                    She hesitated, then turned to face him. “Is everything okay at school?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai froze, his fork halfway to his mouth. “Why?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “You’ve just seemed...off lately,” she said, leaning against the counter. “Quieter than usual. And you’re spending so much time in your room.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” Kai said quickly, forcing a smile. “Just busy with school stuff.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Her eyes narrowed slightly, studying him the way only a mother could. “You know you can talk to me, right? If something’s bothering you?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded, but he couldn’t meet her gaze. “I know.”  
                    <br><br>
                    The rest of the morning passed uneventfully, but Kai couldn’t shake the feeling that his mom was watching him more closely.  
                    <br><br>
                    As he grabbed his backpack and headed for the door, she stopped him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, wait a second,” she said, stepping into the hallway. “You didn’t answer my question earlier. Are you sure everything’s okay?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated, gripping the strap of his backpack tightly. “Yeah, I’m sure. Why wouldn’t it be?”  
                    <br><br>
                    She smiled faintly, but her worry was clear. “Alright. Just...let me know if you need anything.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay,” Kai said, rushing out the door before she could ask anything else.  
                    <br><br>
                    At school, Kai confided in Mike during lunch.  
                    <br><br>
                    “My mom’s starting to notice,” he said, poking at his sandwich.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Notice what?” Mike asked, his mouth full of chips.  
                    <br><br>
                    “That I’m acting weird,” Kai replied. “She keeps asking if something’s wrong.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Well, you are acting weird,” Mike said with a grin.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai glared at him. “Not helping.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay, okay,” Mike said, holding up his hands. “Just...try to act normal. Don’t give her a reason to worry.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai sighed. “Easier said than done.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat in his room, his notebook open on his desk. He stared at the page, his pencil hovering over the paper.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Day 18:</i> Mom’s asking questions. She knows something’s up.  
                    <br><br>
                    He hesitated, then added:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>The new teacher is still watching me. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this secret.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    As he closed the notebook, he heard a soft knock at the door.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai?”  
                    <br><br>
                    His mom’s voice made him jump.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah?” he called, shoving the notebook into his desk drawer.  
                    <br><br>
                    The door creaked open, and she stepped inside, a warm smile on her face. “I just wanted to say goodnight.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Goodnight,” Kai said, trying to sound normal.  
                    <br><br>
                    She lingered for a moment, her gaze drifting around the room. “You’ve been spending a lot of time up here lately.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Just homework,” Kai said quickly.  
                    <br><br>
                    She nodded slowly, then walked over and kissed the top of his head. “Get some rest, okay?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay,” Kai said, his chest tightening.  
                    <br><br>
                    As she left the room, he let out a shaky breath.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, Kai lay awake, staring at the faint glow of the moon through his curtains.  
                    <br><br>
                    He couldn’t shake the feeling that his mom’s questions were just the beginning. If she kept pushing, she might find out the truth.  
                    <br><br>
                    And if she did, everything would change.</p>
