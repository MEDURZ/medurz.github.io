            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The morning sunlight streamed through the window of Kai Paradox's small bedroom, warming the cluttered space with its golden glow. On the floor, a heap of brightly colored toys surrounded a model spaceship he'd built with his father last weekend. His bed, perpetually unmade, was adorned with a patchwork quilt his mother had sewn, patterned with stars and galaxies—her nod to his fascination with space.
                    <br><br>
                    "Kai! Breakfast!" his mother’s voice rang out from downstairs, slicing through the quiet hum of the morning.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai groaned and pulled his blanket over his head. At eight years old, he had perfected the art of procrastinating mornings. His alarm clock, shaped like a cartoon rocket, buzzed again, prompting him to slap the snooze button with a reluctant hand.  
                    <br><br>
                    From the kitchen below, the clatter of pans and the sizzle of bacon carried a comforting familiarity. His father, a tall, broad-shouldered man with a warm laugh, could be heard teasing his wife about her insistence on preparing a "balanced breakfast."  
                    <br><br>
                    “Balanced? Since when does bacon count as balanced, Lisa?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s protein, James! Besides, Kai’s not eating sugary cereal every morning under my watch,” she shot back.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai smiled despite himself. His parents' banter was as much a part of the morning routine as brushing his teeth.  
                    <br><br>
                    Throwing off his blanket, he hopped out of bed, ruffled his already unruly dark brown hair, and grabbed a clean shirt from his dresser. Today’s choice was an astronaut shirt, complete with a rocket blasting off from Earth.  
                    <br><br>
                    Downstairs, the kitchen was filled with the aroma of pancakes and freshly brewed coffee. Lisa Paradox, a petite woman with sharp eyes and a ready smile, stood at the stove flipping pancakes. Her short, practical haircut made her look younger than her thirty-five years. James sat at the table, newspaper spread wide, sipping from a steaming mug emblazoned with “#1 Dad.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Morning, sleepyhead,” James greeted as Kai shuffled in, his eyes still bleary.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Morning,” Kai mumbled, sliding into his usual seat.  
                    <br><br>
                    Lisa placed a plate in front of him. “Eat up. You’ve got a big day ahead.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “What’s so big about it?” Kai asked, cutting into his pancake lazily.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Well,” she began, “it’s career day at school, remember? And James, don’t you have that presentation at work?”  
                    <br><br>
                    James groaned. “Thanks for reminding me, Lisa. Nothing like pitching budget proposals to brighten a Monday.”  
                    <br><br>
                    The conversation flowed easily, filled with small jokes and laughter. Yet, beneath the ordinary rhythm of the morning, there was a strange sense of unease—a subtle tension Kai couldn’t quite name.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai's walk to school was unremarkable, the way most days felt at that age. The narrow streets of his suburban neighborhood were lined with identical houses, each with neatly trimmed lawns and picket fences. Birds chirped in the trees, and a neighbor waved as he passed.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai!” a familiar voice called.  
                    <br><br>
                    He turned to see Mike, his best friend since kindergarten, pedaling furiously toward him on his bike. Mike skidded to a halt beside him, his face flushed with excitement.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Guess what?” Mike said, his eyes wide with mischief.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m gonna bring a live frog to career day. It’ll freak out Mrs. Harper for sure.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai laughed. “You’re gonna get detention for a week.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Worth it,” Mike grinned, hopping off his bike to walk beside Kai.  
                    <br><br>
                    They arrived at school just as the bell rang. The day unfolded like any other—math problems, recess, and the occasional burst of laughter from the back of the classroom where Mike whispered his wild ideas. Yet, Kai couldn't shake the sense that something was different.  
                    <br><br>
                    As the afternoon sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the playground, Kai lingered near the swings. The breeze carried the scent of freshly cut grass, but his thoughts were elsewhere.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, you okay?” Mike asked, nudging him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. “Yeah. Just...thinking.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “About what?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai opened his mouth to answer but stopped. He wasn’t sure. There was nothing unusual about today—or was there?  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as he lay in bed, staring at the faint glow of the moon through his window, the feeling of unease returned. He rolled onto his side, clutching the edge of his quilt.  
                    <br><br>
                    Something was coming. He didn’t know what, but it was as though the universe itself was holding its breath.  </p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 2</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Math class was boring. It was always boring.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai Paradox sat at his desk in Room 3B, staring at a multiplication problem on the board. The numbers swam before his eyes like tiny fish, refusing to line up the way they were supposed to. He tapped his pencil against the desk, trying to focus.  
                    <br><br>
                    The classroom was filled with the usual sounds of shuffling papers, quiet murmurs, and Mrs. Harper’s chalk scratching against the board. She was explaining something about factors, but Kai had stopped listening five minutes ago.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, pay attention,” Mrs. Harper said, glancing his way.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yes, ma’am,” he muttered, sitting up straighter.  
                    <br><br>
                    He hated math, but it wasn’t just the numbers that were bothering him today. It was that same strange feeling from the morning. Like something was about to happen.  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil rolled out of his hand and clattered onto the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    Frustrated, Kai glared at the math problem in front of him. He squeezed his eyes shut and thought, <i>I just want this to be over.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    Then it happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil moved.  
                    <br><br>
                    Not just a little twitch. It floated—just for a second. It hovered about an inch above the desk, spinning slightly. Kai blinked, and the pencil dropped back down with a quiet thud.  
                    <br><br>
                    He froze, his heart pounding. Had anyone else seen?  
                    <br><br>
                    The other kids were busy with their work. Mrs. Harper’s back was to the class as she wrote something on the board.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Did that really just happen?</i> he thought.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai picked up the pencil slowly, turning it over in his hand. It felt normal—light, wooden, with a dull eraser on the end. But he couldn’t ignore what he’d just seen.  
                    <br><br>
                    He tried to focus on his worksheet again, but his mind was racing. He glanced around the room nervously, half expecting someone to call him out.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing.  
                    <br><br>
                    During recess, Kai sat alone on a bench near the soccer field. Mike was playing with a group of kids, yelling and laughing as they chased the ball.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai held his pencil in his lap, staring at it like it held all the answers.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, what’s up with you?” Mike called, jogging over.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shoved the pencil into his pocket quickly. “Nothing. Just thinking.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “About what? You never think,” Mike teased, flopping onto the bench beside him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Very funny.” Kai tried to smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike narrowed his eyes. “You okay? You’ve been weird all day.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” Kai said quickly, standing up. “Come on, let’s play.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike shrugged and followed him to the field. But as the game went on, Kai couldn’t stop thinking about the pencil.  
                    <br><br>
                    At home that evening, Kai sat at the kitchen table, pretending to do his homework.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Everything alright, Kai?” his mom asked as she washed dishes.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah. Why?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “You seem quiet today.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” he said, forcing a smile.  
                    <br><br>
                    She nodded, but her eyes lingered on him for a moment before she turned back to the sink.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s dad walked in, loosening his tie. “How’s my favorite kid doing?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m your only kid, Dad,” Kai replied automatically.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Doesn’t make it any less true.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai chuckled, but the smile faded as soon as his dad left the room.  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the pencil again, holding it carefully. <i>What if I wasn’t imagining it?</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    Upstairs in his room, Kai placed the pencil on his desk. He stared at it, his heart thudding in his chest.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Move,</i> he thought.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    He clenched his fists and tried again. <i>Move!</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil wobbled slightly. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to make Kai’s breath catch.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat back in his chair, staring at the pencil in disbelief.  
                    <br><br>
                    Something was happening to him—something strange and impossible.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="page" id="ch3">
            <h1 class="title">Chapter 3</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The next day felt like it stretched on forever.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai couldn’t stop thinking about the pencil. Every time he replayed the moment in his mind, it seemed more impossible. <i>Pencils don’t float</i>, he told himself again and again.  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat in class, staring at the chalkboard while Mrs. Harper explained something about fractions. His pencil lay untouched on his desk. He didn’t dare try anything again—not here, not with everyone watching.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Mr. Paradox?” Mrs. Harper’s voice jolted him out of his thoughts.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Huh?”  
                    <br><br>
                    She gave him a stern look. “If you’re done daydreaming, perhaps you can solve the problem on the board?”  
                    <br><br>
                    The other kids snickered. Kai’s face turned red as he stood up and shuffled to the front of the room. He picked up the chalk with shaky hands, avoiding everyone’s eyes.  
                    <br><br>
                    The math problem blurred in front of him. He tried to concentrate, but his thoughts kept spiraling. What if the pencil floated again? What if someone saw?  
                    <br><br>
                    “Any day now,” Mrs. Harper said impatiently.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai scribbled an answer on the board—any answer—and hurried back to his seat. He heard the laughter behind him as he sat down, but he didn’t care.  
                    <br><br>
                    At lunch, Mike slid into the seat beside him. “Okay, seriously, what’s going on?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing,” Kai muttered, poking at his sandwich.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned. “Come on, dude. You’ve been acting weird since yesterday. Did Mrs. Harper scare you or something?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “No. I’m fine,” Kai said, more forcefully this time.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike held up his hands. “Alright, alright. But if something’s up, you know you can tell me, right?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded, but he didn’t say anything else.  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat at his desk again, the same pencil lying in front of him.  
                    <br><br>
                    He’d been staring at it for an hour, willing it to move. But no matter how hard he tried, it stayed stubbornly still.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Maybe I imagined it,</i> he thought. <i>Maybe I’m just going crazy.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the pencil and turned it over in his hands. It felt so normal. There was nothing special about it—nothing that could explain what had happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai leaned back in his chair and sighed. His room felt too quiet, too small.  
                    <br><br>
                    The door creaked open, and his mom peeked in. “Kai? Everything okay?”  
                    <br><br>
                    He quickly shoved the pencil under a book. “Yeah. Just tired.”  
                    <br><br>
                    She walked in and sat on the edge of his bed. “You’ve seemed a little off lately. Want to talk about it?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. His mom was always good at listening, but how could he explain something like this?  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” he said finally.  
                    <br><br>
                    She smiled gently and ruffled his hair. “Alright. But if you ever need to talk, I’m here.”  
                    <br><br>
                    After she left, Kai pulled the pencil out again. He placed it carefully in the center of the desk and stared at it until his eyes burned.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Move,</i> he thought.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing.  
                    <br><br>
                    He slammed his fist on the desk, making the pencil jump slightly. But it didn’t float.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai felt a knot of frustration and fear growing in his chest. If he wasn’t imagining it, then what was going on? Was something wrong with him?  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, Kai lay awake in bed, staring at the ceiling. Moonlight filtered through the curtains, casting faint shadows on the walls.  
                    <br><br>
                    He couldn’t stop thinking about the pencil. About how it had floated, even for just a second.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>What if it happens again?</i> he wondered. <i>What if I can’t control it?</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The thought made his stomach churn. He rolled over and buried his face in his pillow, trying to push it all away. But sleep didn’t come easily.  
                    <br><br>
                    And when it finally did, it was restless, filled with strange dreams of objects floating and spinning around him.  </p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The day started like any other, but Kai couldn’t shake the restless feeling that had settled over him. The strange dreams from the night before lingered in his mind—images of floating objects and invisible forces pulling at him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Downstairs, the kitchen was a hub of morning chaos. The smell of scrambled eggs filled the air as Kai’s mom worked over the stove. His dad sipped coffee while reading the newspaper, and the radio played soft jazz in the background.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, grab the plates,” his mom called.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai opened the cabinet and carefully pulled out three plates. He hesitated for a moment, staring at them. What if something happened?  
                    <br><br>
                    He shook the thought away and carried the plates to the table.  
                    <br><br>
                    His mom glanced at him as she slid the eggs onto a platter. “You look tired. Did you stay up late?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “No,” Kai said quickly. “Just had weird dreams.”  
                    <br><br>
                    His dad folded the newspaper and gave Kai a curious look. “What kind of dreams?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing, really. Just...weird stuff.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Probably too many cartoons before bed,” his mom said with a smile.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai forced a laugh, but his chest felt tight. He didn’t want to talk about it—not with them, not with anyone.  
                    <br><br>
                    Later that afternoon, Kai helped his mom with the dishes. It was one of his least favorite chores, but she always insisted it built character.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Pass me the dish towel,” she said, rinsing a plate under the faucet.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai grabbed the towel and handed it to her.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Thanks. So, what’s going on at school?” she asked casually.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Nothing much,” he replied, scrubbing a fork.  
                    <br><br>
                    “You’ve been awfully quiet lately,” she said, her tone light but probing.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m fine,” Kai said quickly. “Just tired.”  
                    <br><br>
                    She nodded, but the worry in her eyes was clear.  
                    <br><br>
                    As Kai reached for another plate, a truck rumbled by outside, shaking the house slightly. The plates in the drying rack rattled.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai froze.  
                    <br><br>
                    The rattling didn’t stop.  
                    <br><br>
                    At first, it was faint, almost like the vibration from the truck had lingered. But then the plates started to clink together louder, trembling against each other as if caught in a small quake.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Kai, stop messing around,” his mom said, turning to look.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I’m not!” he said, panic rising in his voice.  
                    <br><br>
                    She frowned and reached out to steady the plates. The moment her hands touched them, they stopped moving.  
                    <br><br>
                    She looked at him, her eyebrows furrowed. “What was that?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I—I don’t know,” Kai stammered.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Probably the trucks,” she said after a moment, though her voice was uncertain.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai nodded quickly. “Yeah, probably.”  
                    <br><br>
                    But he knew it wasn’t the trucks.  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat alone in his room, his heart still racing from what had happened in the kitchen.  
                    <br><br>
                    He didn’t understand what was going on. First the pencil, now the plates. It wasn’t normal.  
                    <br><br>
                    He grabbed his journal from the desk drawer and flipped it open. It was a plain notebook, the kind he usually used for doodles and notes. But now, it had become something else—a place to keep track of the strange things he couldn’t explain.  
                    <br><br>
                    He wrote quickly, his handwriting messy:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Day 1:</i> Pencil floated. Only for a second. No one saw.  <br>
                    <i>Day 2:</i> Tried to make it move again. It worked, but barely. Nobody noticed.  <br>
                    <i>Day 3:</i> Plates rattled in the kitchen. Mom saw but blamed the trucks.  <br>
                    <br><br>
                    Kai stared at the page, his pencil hovering over the next line. Should he tell someone?  
                    <br><br>
                    The thought made his stomach twist. If he told his parents, would they even believe him? Or would they think he was crazy?  
                    <br><br>
                    He closed the journal and shoved it back into the drawer. No one could know—not yet.  
                    <br><br>
                    That night, as Kai lay in bed, the fear returned. It wasn’t just about the floating pencil or the rattling plates. It was something deeper—a feeling that this was only the beginning.  
                    <br><br>
                    He pulled his blanket up to his chin and stared at the shadows on the ceiling.  
                    <br><br>
                    Whatever was happening to him, he had to figure it out.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 5</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            The house was silent.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai lay awake in his bed, staring at the faint glow of his alarm clock. The numbers read 1:12 AM. He rolled over, but sleep wouldn’t come. His mind kept replaying the events of the past few days—the pencil, the plates, the strange feeling in his chest when it happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, he sat up, the quilt falling into a heap around him. The room was dim, the only light coming from the moon outside. He glanced at the door, listening for any sounds from his parents’ room.  
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing.  
                    <br><br>
                    Slowly, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood. His bare feet were silent on the wooden floor as he crept to his desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil was still there, lying in the exact spot where he’d left it earlier.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai took a deep breath and sat down.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Alright,</i> he thought, staring at the pencil. <i>Let’s figure this out.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    For the first ten minutes, nothing happened.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai tried everything he could think of. He stared at the pencil until his eyes watered. He clenched his fists, gritted his teeth, and even whispered under his breath, “Move. Come on. Move!”  
                    <br><br>
                    The pencil didn’t budge.  
                    <br><br>
                    He groaned and leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples. Maybe he was imagining all of it. Maybe the pencil floating and the plates rattling were just coincidences.  
                    <br><br>
                    But deep down, he didn’t believe that.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai leaned forward again, his hands resting on the edge of the desk. He closed his eyes and focused on the pencil, picturing it in his mind.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Just a little,</i> he thought. <i>Just a tiny bit. Please.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    He felt something—a faint twinge in his chest, like a small spark.  
                    <br><br>
                    When he opened his eyes, the pencil wobbled.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai’s heart leapt. He blinked, afraid it might have been his imagination. But no—the pencil had moved, just barely.  
                    <br><br>
                    Excitement coursed through him. He sat up straighter, his hands gripping the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay,” he whispered. “Let’s try again.”  
                    <br><br>
                    For the next hour, Kai practiced.  
                    <br><br>
                    At first, the pencil only twitched, shifting slightly before falling still. But as the minutes passed, the movements became stronger. It tipped over, rolled, and once—just for a moment—it hovered a fraction of an inch above the desk.  
                    <br><br>
                    By the time the clock read 2:37 AM, Kai was exhausted. His head ached, and his chest felt heavy, but he couldn’t stop smiling.  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the pencil, turning it over in his hands. It was the same as before—just a regular pencil. But now, it felt like something more.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai glanced at the small model spaceship sitting on his shelf. An idea sparked in his mind. He stood and grabbed it, placing it on the desk beside the pencil.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright,” he said softly. “Let’s see if I can do more than just pencils.”  
                    <br><br>
                    He sat back down and focused on the spaceship. It was heavier than the pencil, made of plastic and tiny metal parts.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He thought about the spark in his chest, the feeling he’d had when the pencil moved.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Just a little,</i> he thought. <i>Just enough to see it work.</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The spark came again, faint but steady.  
                    <br><br>
                    When he opened his eyes, the spaceship tilted to one side.  
                    <br><br>
                    By the time Kai finally climbed back into bed, the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon. His body ached with exhaustion, but he felt a strange sense of pride.  
                    <br><br>
                    For the first time, he felt like he had some control over whatever was happening to him.  
                    <br><br>
                    As he drifted off to sleep, a small smile played on his lips.  </p>

            <h1 class="title">Chapter 6</h1>
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>            Kai sat at his desk, staring at the flyer his teacher had handed out that morning. In big, bold letters, it read:  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>“Annual Science Fair – Projects Due in Two Weeks!”</i>  
                    <br><br>
                    The entire class had groaned when Mrs. Harper announced the project. Science fairs were usually just an excuse for parents to build volcanoes or solar system models while the kids watched.  
                    <br><br>
                    But for Kai, this year was different.  
                    <br><br>
                    He twirled his pencil between his fingers, the words on the flyer blurring as he thought. Science was supposed to explain the world—how things worked, why things happened. Maybe it could explain what was happening to him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay,” Kai muttered to himself. “If I have to do this, I might as well make it useful.”  
                    <br><br>
                    He pulled out his notebook and began to brainstorm.  
                    <br><br>
                    At recess, Kai found Mike sitting under their usual tree, munching on a peanut butter sandwich.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, Mike,” Kai said, plopping down beside him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey. What’s up?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I need an idea for the science fair,” Kai said, trying to sound casual.  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike grinned. “How about a frog-launching catapult?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai snorted. “Yeah, that’ll definitely win first prize.”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Hey, it’s better than a potato battery,” Mike said, shoving the last bit of sandwich into his mouth.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai hesitated. “What about...magnetism?”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike frowned. “Like magnets and stuff? That sounds kinda boring.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai shrugged. “Maybe. But I think it could be cool if I make it...different.”  
                    <br><br>
                    Mike gave him a suspicious look. “Different how?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “I don’t know yet,” Kai said quickly. “But I’ll figure it out.”  
                    <br><br>
                    That evening, Kai sat at the kitchen table, scribbling in his notebook while his mom cooked dinner.  
                    <br><br>
                    “What’s all this?” she asked, glancing at the pages filled with messy diagrams and notes.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Science fair project,” Kai said without looking up.  
                    <br><br>
                    His mom smiled. “Look at you, all serious about school for once. What’s the project about?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “Magnetism,” Kai said.  
                    <br><br>
                    She raised an eyebrow. “Sounds ambitious. Need any help?”  
                    <br><br>
                    “No, I’ve got it,” Kai said, flipping to a blank page.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Alright, but don’t wait until the last minute,” she said, setting a plate of spaghetti in front of him.  
                    <br><br>
                    “I won’t,” Kai mumbled, though he wasn’t so sure.  
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next few days, Kai threw himself into the project. He borrowed books from the school library, watched videos online, and even asked his dad to take him to the hardware store to buy magnets and copper wire.  
                    <br><br>
                    But every time he worked on it, his thoughts drifted back to his powers.  
                    <br><br>
                    What if he could use them for the project? Would anyone notice?  
                    <br><br>
                    The idea both excited and terrified him.  
                    <br><br>
                    A week before the science fair, Kai set up his experiment in his room. He had built a small contraption using magnets, wires, and a motor he’d taken from an old toy car. The goal was to show how magnetism could create movement—something simple enough to explain but still impressive.  
                    <br><br>
                    As he worked, he couldn’t resist testing his powers.  
                    <br><br>
                    He placed a metal washer on the desk and focused on it, the way he’d practiced late at night.  
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Move,</i> he thought, his chest tightening with effort.  
                    <br><br>
                    The washer wobbled, then slid across the desk toward him.  
                    <br><br>
                    Kai grinned, his heart pounding.  
                    <br><br>
                    He picked up the washer and placed it back on the desk. This time, he tried something different. Instead of thinking about moving it, he imagined it hovering—floating just like the pencil had.  
                    <br><br>
                    The washer lifted off the desk, wobbling slightly before falling back down with a soft clink.  
                    <br><br>
                    “Whoa,” Kai whispered, staring at it.  
                    <br><br>
                    He couldn’t use his powers in front of everyone at the science fair. That much was obvious. But the thought of practicing in secret, of understanding what he could really do, made him feel a little less afraid.  
                    <br><br>
                    The night before the science fair, Kai lay in bed staring at the ceiling.  
                    <br><br>
                    His project was ready, and he felt confident it would work. But what really excited him wasn’t the magnets or the motor.  
                    <br><br>
                    It was the possibility that he could understand himself—that maybe, just maybe, science could help him figure out who he was becoming.  </p>
